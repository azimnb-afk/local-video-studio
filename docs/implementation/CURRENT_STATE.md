# CURRENT_STATE

Updated: 2026-08-09

## Current Phase
Phase A1 — First Run / Dependency Onboarding is PRODUCTION COMPLETE. Centralized dependency health management (`DependencyHealthManager`) and non-blocking onboarding UI (`SetupWizardView`) are fully integrated and verified across all app generation triggers (Generate, One Shot, Storyboard, Hybrid, Retakes, History).

## Completed
- Source acquisition: cloned `james-see/ltx-video-mac` (MIT) @ `a441dc2` → branch `director-extensions`.
- Phase 0: audit + SPM build/test harness + measured baselines (BASELINE.md, BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md).
- Phase 1: ModelRegistry + VideoGenerationAdapter boundary + backward-compatible metadata + rollback-capable FeatureFlags.
- Phase 2: CompatibilityLab (11-check gate), ManifestValidator, ModelInstaller (no auto-download), Adult Mode + policy at Service/API layers, Preferences "Models & Features" tab.
- Phase 3: MemoryMonitor/HardwareProfiler/QualityProfile ladder/AutoQualityEngine/HistoricalSuccessStore, fallback retry (max 3), MediaProbe wiring, LowRAMMLXAdapter boundary (Runtime Verification Pending), lowram_bench.sh.
- Phase 4: One Shot Director (Ollama loopback provider + template fallback, terminate-before-render), OneShotPlan, PromptCompiler, DialogueNormalizer, UI disclosure.
- Phase 5: FilmProject/Shot/Take (1–20 sequential takes), versioned atomic persistence, resume reconciliation (real MP4 = truth).
- Phase 6: ContinuityEngine (deterministic directives + validator + monotony rules), StoryboardDirector (hybrid, sequential roles), FinalAssemblyService (stream-copy/normalize+concat) — verified against real MP4s.
- Phase 7: LocalAPIServer v1 (loopback + token + asset sandbox + policy), extras/openclaw.
- CharacterBible Phase 0-6: Production UX complete for Character Reference assets and Starting Image conditioning.
- **Phase A1: First Run / Dependency Onboarding**:
  - `DependencyHealthManager` singleton aggregating `SetupRequirement` statuses (`.python`, `.ffmpeg`, `.videoModel`, `.textEncoder`, `.localDirector`, `.vision`).
  - Required vs Optional dependency split: Python, FFmpeg, Video Model, and Text Encoder are Required (`isGenerationReady = true` when all 4 are `.ready`); Ollama / Vision are Optional and do not block Generation.
  - Python validation uses subprocess execution, version check, and `mlx_video` import verification. Invalid saved path triggers automatic recovery via `autoDetectPython()`.
  - Non-blocking UI: App browsing, Archive, Projects, CharacterBible, and Settings remain fully accessible even if required dependencies are missing.
  - Unified Generation Gating: Every generation trigger (Generate, Add to Queue, Batch, One Shot, Storyboard Take, Generate Missing Takes, Regenerate Selected Shots, Hybrid auto generation, Retake, History) checks `isGenerationReady` and routes to `SetupWizardView` when dependencies are lacking.
  - Safety & Privacy: No silent `pip install`, `brew install`, `sudo`, system Python mutation, or auto-downloads. No API keys or credentials exported in `copyDiagnostics()`.
